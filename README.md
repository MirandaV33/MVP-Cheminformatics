# Drug Repurposing Project with REINVENT and Connectivity Map

This project explores the repurposing of drugs for a given biological condition using gene expression data and the Connectivity Map. Molecules were generated using REINVENT 4 based on the top candidates identified by a Random Forest classifier.

> üß™ The full pipeline was implemented and executed in **Google Colab**.  
> üìÅ To reproduce the REINVENT generation step, please follow the installation and usage instructions in the [official REINVENT repository]([https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent](https://github.com/MolecularAI/REINVENT4/tree/main)).

## Repository Structure

- `data/`  
  Contains all source files used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and query the Connectivity Map. Includes the `nc2.gctx` file and other CSVs used.

- `generate_molecules/`  
  Includes input and output files from REINVENT, as well as the generated molecules and log files from the generation runs.

- `results/`  
  Tables and plots generated by the Colab notebook. Includes .csv and .png files summarizing model results and analyses.

- `notebooks/`  
  Main Google Colab notebook used for analysis and generation.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to how Google Colab handles paths and Google Drive integration, this code may not directly run in Jupyter Notebook without adaptation.
