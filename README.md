# Drug Repurposing Project with REINVENT and Connectivity Map

This project explores the repurposing of drugs for a Hepatitis disease using gene expression data. Molecules were generated using REINVENT 4 based on the top candidates identified by Connectivity Map from CLUE.io

## Repository Structure

- `data/`  
  Contains all source files used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and query the Connectivity Map. Includes the `nc2.gctx` file and other CSVs used.

- `generate_molecules/`  
  Includes input and output files from REINVENT, as well as the generated molecules and log files from the generation runs.

- `results/`  
  Tables and plots generated by the Colab notebook. Includes .csv and .png files summarizing model results and analyses.

- `notebooks/`  
  Main Google Colab notebook used for analysis and generation.

> Due to how Google Colab handles paths and Google Drive integration, this code may not directly run in Jupyter Notebook without adaptation.


> **Important:**  
> The main notebook is developed to run in Google Colab, so it may require adaptations to run properly in a local Jupyter Notebook environment.  
>  
> - If you want to run the notebook locally, we recommend downloading all files to your own Google Drive or local folder.  
> - You need to install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.  
> - Also, you must modify the code to remove or adapt Colab-specific commands such as `!pip install` and Google Drive integration (`drive.mount()`), as they do not work the same way in Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

To reproduce the REINVENT generation step, please follow the installation and usage instructions in the official REINVENT4 repository.
